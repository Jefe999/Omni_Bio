### üìà Statistical Analysis (`statistical_analysis/`)
- **plots/**: Volcano plots, statistical visualizations
- **results/**: T-test results, significant features, statistical summaries

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Models (`ml_models/`)
- **trained_models/**: Serialized ML models (.pkl files)
- **evaluation/**: ROC curves, performance metrics, validation results
- **feature_importance/**: Feature ranking and importance scores

### üìÅ Data Files (`data_files/`)
- **raw/**: Original input data files
- **processed/**: Cleaned and normalized feature matrices
- **metadata/**: Sample information and experimental metadata

### üìÑ Reports (`reports/`)
- **html/**: Interactive HTML analysis report
- **json/**: Machine-readable analysis summary

### üìñ Documentation (`documentation/`)
- Additional documentation and methodology notes

## Key Files

### Analysis Report
- `reports/html/analysis_report.html` - Comprehensive HTML report with visualizations
- `reports/json/analysis_summary.json` - Machine-readable analysis summary

### Data Files
- `data_files/processed/` - Final processed feature matrices ready for analysis
- `statistical_analysis/results/` - Complete statistical test results

### Models
- `ml_models/trained_models/` - Trained biomarker classification models
- `ml_models/evaluation/` - Model performance evaluation

## Usage Instructions

### Viewing Results
1. Open `reports/html/analysis_report.html` in a web browser for the main report
2. Review `MANIFEST.txt` for a complete file listing
3. Check `statistical_analysis/results/` for detailed biomarker rankings

### Using Trained Models
The trained models in `ml_models/trained_models/` can be loaded using:

```python
import pickle
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
```

### Data Format
- Feature matrices are saved as CSV files with samples as rows
- Statistical results include p-values, fold changes, and significance flags
- All plots are provided in high-resolution PNG format

## Analysis Pipeline

This analysis was performed using the OmniBio biomarker discovery pipeline, which includes:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Support for mwTab and mzML formats
2. **Quality Control**: TIC/BPC analysis, PCA for batch effects
3. **Statistical Analysis**: T-tests, multiple testing correction, volcano plots
4. **Machine Learning**: Logistic regression with cross-validation
5. **Biomarker Ranking**: Feature importance and statistical significance

## Support
